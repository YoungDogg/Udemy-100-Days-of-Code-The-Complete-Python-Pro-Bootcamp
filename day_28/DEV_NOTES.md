# TODO
- [x] separate ui work inside countdown class
  - [x] update_ui at main.py
- [x] start, stop, and reset
  - [x] start
    -[x] how to pass countdown class function to ui?
      - [x] bridging main class as connector
    - [x] how to set scope functions of a class?
      - same as attributes
        - public (default)
        - protected (convention) : a single underscore within its subclass
        - private (name mangling): two underscores only its class
    - [x] if start pressed again, it stops
      - [x] toggle text start to stop
      - [x] stop function worked
        - storing the value inside countdown class  
  - [x] reset
    - [x] if pressed reset, make button stop
- [ ] routine: work and break
  - [ ] change main, and countdown classes compatible with this routine
    - [ ] countdown class
      - [ ] divide above with start, stop, and reset into different classes
    - [ ] main class
  - [ ] when the process finished both start and reset button reset the process
    - [ ] when reset pressed, make the routine reset too
    - [ ] if press start button, reset and start again
  - [ ] ui
    - [ ] display current process using check mark:✔️ ❌
      - initial all task x
      - check as the routine passes by
- [x] refactor
  - [x] enum: UIText, TimerState, WorkState
    - UIText class required `.value` while timer_state didn't. 
      - UIText needs its vlaue while timer_state only checks logical states
- [ ] test
  - [ ] how to make test class?
  - testing routine with hardcoding is not good. Any good method?
- [ ] document
  - [ ] following the process
