# Guess US States
# Rules
- Convert the guess to Title case
- Check if the guess is among the 50 states
- Write correct guesses onto the map
- Use a loop to allow the user to keep guessing 
- Record the correct guesses in a list
- Keep track of the score

# what will require
- [x] Check if the guess is among the 50 states
  - [x] the array of 50 states
- [x] Write correct guesses onto the map
  - [x] get state place coordinate considering click margin
    - [x] get the coordinate of game window
    - [x] compare with the coordinate data list
      - [x] get coordinate data list
      - [x] make condition comparing the coordinates of clicking and the data list 
      - [x] get corresponding state name 
    - [x] input popup
      - [ ] handle the error (optional)
        - [ ] if click no
  - [x] condition comparing input and the state list
    - [x] make the condition
    - [x] make the score
      - [x] UI
        - [x] highest score
      - [x] file
  - [ ] Refactor
    - [ ] Divide into classes      
      - [ ] screen
      - [x] data
      - [x] stateLocator
      - [x] score
        - used singleton for score value
  - question
    - [ ] class variable inside \__init__. should it be __var?
      - no underscore is for public
      - one underscore is for protected attribute, internal use
      - double underscore called **Name Mangling**
    - [ ] how to get global value inside main function to other class?
    - [ ] when share class object to other class? came this thought from Score class getting screen
      - my classes share each other on main.py
    - [ ] in class attribute, difference self.__fo, fo in def \__init__(self)
  - fix
    - [x] highest
      - [x] highest score display 0, fix it
        - [x] if it's none, make it as 0        
      - [x] move the highest score display digit
    - [x] score increments weirdo
        - self.__score += 1 (v) 
        - why this incremented drastically self.score += 1
        - something related to singleton
          - no it wasn't. The setter was the problem. changed self.__score += val to this self.__score = val
    - [x] make game shut after game over
