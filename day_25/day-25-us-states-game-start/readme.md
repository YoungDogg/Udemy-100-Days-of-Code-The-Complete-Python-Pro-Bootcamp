# what will require
- [x] Check if the guess is among the 50 states
  - [x] the array of 50 states
- [x] Write correct guesses onto the map
  - [x] get state place coordinate considering click margin
    - [x] get the coordinate of game window
    - [x] compare with the coordinate data list
      - [x] get coordinate data list
      - [x] make condition comparing the coordinates of clicking and the data list 
      - [x] get corresponding state name 
    - [x] input popup
      - [ ] handle the error (optional)
        - [ ] if click no

      - [ ] screen
      - [x] data
      - [x] stateLocator
      - [x] score
        - used singleton for score value
  - question
    - [ ] class variable inside \__init__. should it be __var?
    - [ ] how to get global value inside main function to other class?
    - [ ] when share class object to other class? came this thought from Score class getting screen
    - [ ] in class attribute, difference self.__fo, fo in def \__init__(self)
  - fix
    - [ ] highest
      - [ ] highest score display 0, fix it
        - [ ] if it's none, make it as 0
      - [x] move the highest score display digit
    - [ ] score increments weirdo
        - self.__score += 1 (v) 
        - why this incremented drastically self.score += 1
    - [x] make game shut after game over
